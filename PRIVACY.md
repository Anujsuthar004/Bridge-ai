BridgeAI Privacy Policy

BridgeAI is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to be a local-first tool.

1. Data Collection: BridgeAI does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) to external servers. 2. Data Usage: Conversation context scraped from AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) is stored temporarily in the browser's local storage solely to facilitate the transfer of that context to a new tab. 3. Data Security: All data processing happens locally on the user's machine. We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. 4. Data Retention: Temporary data used for transfers is automatically cleared from local storage once the transfer is complete or after a period of inactivity.
